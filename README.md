# Getting Started with Create React App
### App is hosted live [here](https://oranges-todo-app.netlify.app/).
This todo-app project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It uses localStorage to store the user's todo list.

### Improvements Done 
- Uncompleted items are now not greyed out when using uncompleted filter
- Empty inputs not allowed
- Some people couldn't read todo as to-do, changed that to explicitly read to-do :p

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
